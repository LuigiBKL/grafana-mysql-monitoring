mysql-metrics role
==================

> This role attempts to spin up the percona / graphite / mysql setup, and add some additional settings to work properly. 

See documentation in root directory for more info on how it works.  Specifically not going into much detail here as it's not meant to be used without the docker-compose aspect of this setup.
